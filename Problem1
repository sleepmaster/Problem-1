Looking up the length and width of the Golden Gate Bridge which is 2,788m and 27m respectively. And assuming that the penny could only be laid out on flat ground. 
Then looking up the radius of the penny which is 9.5 * 10 ^-3 m. Then we know that the area of a penny is 0.00028338 m^2. 
Therefore taking the area of the Golden Gate Bridge (ignoring the towers), we divide that area by that of the penny. 
So 75276/0.00028338 = 265636248 pennies that you could fit on the Golden Gate Bridge with no overlap.
